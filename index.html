        <p>my love nandni,</p>

        <p>
          on <strong>18th december</strong> it was our 2 months and i forgot to wish you.
          i shouldn’t have. i’m really sorry baby. there’s no excuse for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          these two months mean a lot to me. more than i usually say.
          you’ve become a part of my everyday life without me even realising it.
          i think about you randomly. i feel calm just knowing you’re there.
        </p>

        <p>
          i forgot the date, but i never forgot us. never forgot you.
          still, i understand if this hurt you even a little, and that’s on me.
          i hate the idea of being the reason you feel bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          that’s why i made this. not to be dramatic or anything.
          just because i wanted you to know that i care. a lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          i’m not perfect. i make stupid mistakes.
          but i don’t take you lightly. i don’t want to lose you.
          you are one of the best things that has happened to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>happy 2 months, my love.</strong><br>
          late, but meant with my whole heart.
        </p>

        <p class="end">i love you so much ♡</p>
